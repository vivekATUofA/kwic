# KWIC - Key Word In Context (All Architectural Styles)

This project contains four implementations of the KWIC system, each demonstrating a different software architecture style:

1. **Shared Memory (Main + Subroutines)**
2. **Object-Oriented (Abstract Data Types)**
3. **Event-Based (Implicit Invocation)**
4. **Pipes and Filters (Data Flow)**

## â–¶ How to Compile and Run

You must have **Java (11 or above)** installed. Navigate to the folder of the architecture you want to run and follow the steps:

### 1. Shared Memory
```bash
cd shared_memory
javac KWIC_SharedMemory.java
java KWIC_SharedMemory
```

### 2. Object-Oriented
```bash
cd object_oriented
javac *.java
java KWIC_ObjectOriented
```

### 3. Event-Based
```bash
cd event_based
javac *.java
java KWIC_EventBased
```

### 4. Pipes and Filters
```bash
cd pipes_and_filters
javac *.java
java KWIC_PipesAndFilters
```
